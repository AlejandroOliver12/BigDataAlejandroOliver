##### Method Elbow
Elbow method
This method uses the inertia values  obtained after applying the K-means to different number of Clusters (from 1 to N Clusters), the inertia being the sum of the squared distances of each object in the Cluster to its centroid:

Once the inertia values  have been obtained after applying the K-means from 1 to N Clusters, we represent in a linear graph the inertia with respect to the number of Clusters. In this graph, a sudden change in the evolution of inertia should be appreciated, with the line represented in a similar way to that of an arm and its elbow. The point at which this sudden change in inertia is observed will tell us the optimal number of Clusters to select for that dataset; Or put another way: the point that would represent the elbow of the arm will be the optimal number of Clusters for that data set.
