##### Pearson Correlacion
Pearson's correlation coefficient is a test that measures the statistical relationship between two continuous variables. If the association between the elements is not linear, then the coefficient is not adequately represented.

The correlation coefficient can take a range of values ​​from +1 to -1. A value of 0 indicates that there is no association between the two variables. A value greater than 0 indicates a positive association. That is, as the value of one variable increases, so does the value of the other. A value less than 0 indicates a negative association; that is, as the value of one variable increases, the value of the other decreases.

To carry out the Pearson correlation it is necessary to fulfill the following:
1. The measurement scale must be an interval or ratio scale.
2. The variables must be roughly distributed.
3. The association must be linear.
4. There should be no outliers in the data.


When we square the Pearson correlation coefficient, its meaning changes, and we interpret its value in relation to the forecasts (indicates causality of the relationship). That is, in this case, it can have four interpretations or meanings:


Associated Variance:
Indicates the proportion of the variance of Y (one variable) associated with the variation of X (the other variable). Therefore, we will know that "1-squared Pearson coefficient" = "proportion of the variance of Y that is not associated with the variation of X".

Individual Differences:
If we multiply the Pearson correlation coefficient x100, it will be indicating the% of the individual differences in Y that are associated / depend on / are explained by the individual variations or differences in X.

Error Reduction Index
The squared Pearson correlation coefficient can also be interpreted as an index of the reduction in forecast error; that is, it would be the proportion of the mean square error eliminated using Y '(the regression line, elaborated from the results) instead of the mean of Y as a forecast.

Point Approach Index
Finally, the last interpretation of the squared Pearson correlation coefficient would indicate the approximation of the points to the commented regression line. The greater the value of the coefficient (closer to 1), the closer the points are to Y '(to the line).
